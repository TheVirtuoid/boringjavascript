            <p><aside>A camp near Forres. Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant</aside></p>
            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                What bloody man is that? He can report,
                As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
                The newest state.</p>
            <p>
                <span>MALCOLM</span>
                This is the sergeant
                Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
                'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
                Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
                As thou didst leave it.</p>
            <p><span>Sergeant</span>
                Doubtful it stood;
                As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
                And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
                Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
                The multiplying villanies of nature
                Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
                Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
                And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
                Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
                For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
                Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
                Which smoked with bloody execution,
                Like valour's minion carved out his passage
                Till he faced the slave;
                Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
                Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
                And fix'd his head upon our battlements.</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!</p>
            <p><span>Sergeant</span>
                As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
                Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
                So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
                Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
                No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
                Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
                But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
                With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
                Began a fresh assault.</p>
            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                Dismay'd not this
                Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?</p>
            <p><span>Sergeant</span>
                Yes;
                As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
                If I say sooth, I must report they were
                As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
                Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
                Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
                Or memorise another Golgotha,
                I cannot tell.
                But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
                They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
            <aside> Exit Sergeant, attended</aside>

            Who comes here?
            <aside>Enter ROSS</aside></p>

            <p><span>MALCOLM</span>
                The worthy thane of Ross.</p>

            <p id="lennox"><span>LENNOX</span>
                What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
                That seems to speak things strange.</p>

            <p><span>ROSS</span>
                God save the king!</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                Whence camest thou, worthy thane?</p>
            <p><span>ROSS</span>
                From Fife, great king;
                Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
                And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
                With terrible numbers,
                Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
                The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
                Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
                Confronted him with self-comparisons,
                Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
                Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
                The victory fell on us.</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                Great happiness!</p>
            <p><span>ROSS</span>
                That now
                Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
                Nor would we deign him burial of his men
                Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
                Ten thousand dollars to our general use.</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
                Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
                And with his former title greet Macbeth.</p>

            <p><span>ROSS</span>
                I'll see it done.</p>

            <p><span>DUNCAN</span>
                What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.</p>
            <p><aside>Exeunt</aside></p>
